# 100DaysOfML

## Day 1 : Aug 21, 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have learnt about google datalab api and Tensorflow estimators

**Thoughts** : Tensorflow is a fucking powerfull framework, it's awesome to see how to solve an ML problem with such simplicity of code. Datalab doesn't impressed me that much. I'm not quite into Notebooks yet. I miss having VIM superpowers, and web editting feels terrible bad. Also the connection with github repositories sucks.



## Day 2 : Aug 22, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learnt Pandas DataFrames basics and solved my first problem from scratch, implementing a DNN.

**Thoughts** : Datalab and Notebooks are cool. The problem with the repository conection is somehow addressed with ungit, which is a really nice interface to git. Using tensorflow is a bomb!
